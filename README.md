# Unhandled Exceptions in Dart Asynchronous Operations

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart asynchronous programming: unhandled exceptions within `async`/`await` blocks. The `bug.dart` file shows a function that fetches data from an API.  While it includes a `try-catch` block, the exception handling is incomplete, potentially leading to silent failures or unexpected program termination.

The solution (`bugSolution.dart`) addresses the issue by ensuring that exceptions are properly handled at all levels and provides more informative error messages.
